Revision Diary (October 2025 Update)

This version focuses on improving clarity, organization, and reproducibility across the entire NHANES blood pressure vignette. 

The code, tables, and section flow have been streamlined to align with the textbook and your previous feedbacks.

1. Main Revisions

(1) Cleaner output and reproducible tables

All raw console outputs were hidden.

Model summaries are now programmatically extracted and formatted using helper functions with knitr::kable().

Eliminated manual table transcription to ensure reproducibility.

(2) Section 7: Model sequence reorganization

Split into clear subsections:

7.1 Linear age models (Table 1a)

7.2 Spline age models (Table 1b)

7.3 Spline + age×sex models (Table 1c)

7.4 Combined comparison of all models

7.5 Brief discussion summarizing key results

Tables 1a–1c are generated automatically and compared side-by-side.

Section rewritten for smoother narrative and compact presentation.

(3) Section 8: Diagnostics 

Retained textbook structure but rewritten for readability.

Clarified residual and partial residual plots, emphasizing survey-weighted smoothers and diagnostic interpretation.

Simplified code to maintain conceptual focus.

(4) Section 9: Interaction and advanced models

Kept full model set for completeness.

Rewrote each subsection for consistency and interpretability:

9.1–9.2 Centered-age SBP and DBP interaction models.

9.3 (moved up) Table 2 summarizing interactions — now positioned directly after model fitting.

9.4 Natural spline × sex models clarified.

9.5 Marginal effects by age rewritten as a readable interpretation tool.

2. Structural Improvements

Section numbering and transitions standardized for logical progression.

All tables labeled with consistent captions and units (mmHg/g/day; SE in parentheses).

Narrative paragraphs rewritten in concise bullet or short-paragraph format for better readability.

3. Outstanding Points

Future iterations may condense preprocessing sections and consider adding visualization for marginal effects.

Advanced interaction sections (spline and age×sex) can later be moved to an appendix if needed.

4. Summary

This revision transforms the vignette into a polished, reproducible tutorial with:

Programmatic and consistent table generation

Streamlined section flow (7 → 8 → 9)

Concise interpretation instead of raw output

Alignment with the textbook’s analytical framework

Overall, this version emphasizes clarity, compact structure, and reproducibility while maintaining the technical depth of the original analysis.
